## Description
This will be my first self directed project. I will be creating a crypto data aggregator whose functions are similar to that of websites such as Taptools and Coingecko. The function of this website will be to aggregate crypto data of tokens on the Blast blockchain and display that information to users in a UI friendly manner. Blast is a newly released blockchain by the web3 team behind Blur.
